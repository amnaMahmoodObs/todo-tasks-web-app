## Prompt

Create a constitution for a Phase I Python console todo application. This is an in-memory CLI app built using spec-driven development with Claude Code. Requirements: (1) All code must be generated by Claude Code from specs - manual coding is prohibited. (2) Implements 5 basic CRUD features: add task, view tasks, update task, delete task, mark complete. (3) Uses Python 3.13+ with UV package manager. (4) Follows PEP 8 and clean code principles. (5) Architecture: main.py for CLI loop, cli.py for user interface, todo.py for Todo class, storage.py for in-memory storage using Python dict/list. (6) Error handling for all user inputs with friendly messages. (7) Type hints and docstrings required. (8) Data model: each task has id, title, description, completed status, created_at timestamp. (9) No external libraries beyond Python standard library. (10) This is Phase I of a 5-phase hackathon evolving from CLI to cloud-native Kubernetes deployment. Emphasize spec-driven workflow: write spec -> Claude Code generates -> test -> refine spec only.

## Response snapshot

Constitution v1.0.0 created with 7 core principles:

1. **Spec-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: All code generated by Claude Code from specs; manual coding prohibited
2. **Claude Code as Primary Tool**: Exclusive code generation engine
3. **Clean Architecture**: 4-module structure (main.py, cli.py, todo.py, storage.py)
4. **Type Safety and Documentation**: Type hints and Google-style docstrings required
5. **Robust Error Handling**: Validated inputs with friendly error messages
6. **Standard Library Only**: No external dependencies in Phase I
7. **Hackathon Evolution Readiness**: Design for 5-phase evolution (CLI → File → SQLite → REST API → K8s)

Additional sections: Code Quality Standards, Development Workflow (mandatory spec-driven flow), Governance (amendment process, compliance, ADR policy).

Data model defined: Todo with id, title, description, completed, created_at.

Templates reviewed for compatibility: plan-template.md, spec-template.md, tasks-template.md (all compatible).

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Project constitution established as authoritative governance document for Phase I Python todo console app
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (governance document)
- 📁 Files: Created .specify/memory/constitution.md (v1.0.0)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Create feature specification using /sp.specify, then generate plan with /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution balances Phase I simplicity (standard library only, manual testing) with evolution readiness (clean architecture, interface patterns for future persistence layers). NON-NEGOTIABLE spec-driven principle ensures learning objective met.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A (initial constitution)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Monitor if 25-line function limit proves too restrictive for CLI menu logic; consider MINOR version bump if adjustment needed
